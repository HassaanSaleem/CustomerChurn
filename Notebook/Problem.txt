For a B2C company customer churn is a very serious problem, the business intelligence team have come up with some attributes that they think 
contributes to customer churn. As an ML engineer, they expect you to put up a risk score against each customer.

Training data contains 37 features and a label variable where 0 represents not churn and 1 represents churn.

Given the following dataset:

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

a. document all the step you have taken to perform exploratory data analysis
b. what conclusion have you drawn from the EDA

2. Use machine learning algorithm to assign a risk score

3. What features contribute most to the risk score that you have assigned to a customer.

P.S : For security purpose, we cannot share the description of the predictor variables.
